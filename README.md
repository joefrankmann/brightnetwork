# Simple Job Recommendation System with Python

This Python code is a basic job recommendation system that matches members with job opportunities based on their location and job title preferences. It processes JSON data for members and jobs, extracts relevant information from members' bios, and suggests suitable job positions.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Run the code provided in this repository.

3. No dependencies are necessary

## Code Explanation

The code consists of the following main parts:

- **Data Processing**: The code processes the JSON data and extracts relevant information such as member names, bios, job titles, and job locations.

- **Recommendation Algorithm**: The algorithm extracts member location from the list of major UK cities and job title preferences based on words in the member's bio. It matches members with jobs based on their preferences and stores recommendations in a dictionary.

- **Recommendations**: The code prints out recommendations, including job titles and their locations, for each member.

## Choices and Limitations

### Choices Made

- **Simplicity**: The code is intentionally kept simple to serve as a basic demonstration of a job recommendation system. It focuses on extracting basic information from member bios and job data to make recommendations.


### Limitations

While this code provides a basic job recommendation system, it has several limitations:

1. **Simplicity**: The code offers a straightforward approach to job recommendations and does not consider more advanced recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

2. **Data Quality**: The effectiveness of the recommendations is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the data. In practice, members may have diverse and complex bios that are not well-handled by the basic text analysis used in this code.

3. **Scalability**: For larger datasets, the code may become inefficient as it uses simple linear searches for matching members with jobs.

4. **User Engagement**: The code does not interact with users to gather more specific preferences, and the recommendations are solely based on the provided data.

5. **Maintenance**: The code may require regular updates and modifications as member bios and job data evolve.

For a production-quality recommendation system, more advanced techniques and a more extensive dataset should be used. Additionally, user engagement and feedback mechanisms should be considered to improve recommendations and user experience.
